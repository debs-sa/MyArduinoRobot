As the activity proposal is to 'make something cool,' I thought about making something that
everybody (or almost everybody, but especially me) is interested in: a robot. I started looking at some
projects on the internet, and there are a lot of them. Basically, my idea was to do research on how to build
a robot that uses the Ultrasonic Sensor to move itself and also includes other features that I had studied
in class.
So, I added to my project an LCD with a potentiometer, an RGB led, and a buzzer with a red led,
organized in one circuit built with small breadboards. The system is controlled by the Arduino Uno Controller
Board and the L293D Motor Driver Module, which also controls the robot chassis (gear motors/wheels),
Micro Servo Motor, and Ultrasonic Sensor.
